# Sodium - SOcial DIstance Unto Medicos
An app that connects patients and doctors with social distancing for COVID-19

Given, "Social distance" as the only remedy out of COVID-19, along with general public, It is necessary for doctors to social distance with patients. Though doctor-patient contact cant be eliminated completely, my app tries to reduce realworld contact as much as possible, unless necessary.
