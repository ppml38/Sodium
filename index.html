Sodium imposes social distance between doctors and patients.<br><br>

During current spread of COVID-19, "Social distancing" is proven to be the single most practice that can prevent COVID-19 spread.<br>
Governments are making it mandatory for general public, Though that include doctors, nurses and health workers, they cannot distance themselves from patients, especially inside hospital. and we cannot lose them for infection.<br>
Although, It is nearly impossible to completely eliminate Doctor-patient contact, <b>Sodium</b> app is designed to reduce realworld contact between them as much as possible, unless necessary.<br><br>

Specially designed for COVID-19 temporary hospitals that handle large number of patients with minimal or no IT infrastructures
Sodium is designed to run even in your daily laptop or a raspberry pie.<br><br>
